An ideal destination to experience a flourishing natural landscape, abundant in flora and fauna, and be one with the quiet and peace that it has to offer. It is an ideal place to disconnect from our screens and technology and be one with our origins, a place where we actually originated from",

    desc: "A desert is a barren area of landscape where little precipitation occurs and, consequently, living conditions are hostile for plant and animal life. The lack of vegetation exposes the unprotected surface of the ground to denudation. About one-third of the land surface of the Earth is arid or semi-arid.",

    desc: "  A waterfall is a point in a river or stream where water flows over a vertical drop or a series of steep drops. Waterfalls also occur where meltwater drops over the edge of a tabular iceberg or ice shelf Waterfalls can be formed in several ways, but the most common method of formation is that a river courses over a top layer of resistant bedrock before falling on to softer rock, which erodes faster, leading to an increasingly high fall. Waterfalls have been studied for their impact on species living in and around them.",

Travellers are advised to consult their doctor or travel medical specialist before leaving for a trip by sea, especially if they have existing medical conditions or are in high risk groups.",
